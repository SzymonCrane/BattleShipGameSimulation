This is a sample project of BattleShip simulation game

Below is my first even written documentation

I started from creating project files management -> folder Board conatins classes which declare all sources of boarding the game
Coordinates -> defines properties of coordinate which are integers - row & column,

FiringBoard -> this class defines all actions that take place on firing board:
- Declares finding possible shot coordinates with GetOpenRandomSpaceOnBoard List, 
- To avoid shooting in the same spot more than once I've had to declare GetNearHit function which gives list of coords that have already been shot.
- GetNearShip takes coordinates and returns free spaces to shoot

GameBoard -> This class creates propertie SpaceOnBoards which is later commonly used to get a specified coordinates, also contains GameBoard() object who generates boards to fire and place ships
