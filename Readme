This is a sample project of BattleShip simulation game

Below is my first even written documentation

I started from creating project files management -> 
folder Board conatins classes which declare all sources of boarding the game

Coordinates -> defines properties of coordinate which are integers - row & column,

FiringBoard -> this class defines all actions that take place on firing board:
- Declares finding possible shot coordinates with GetOpenRandomSpaceOnBoard List, 
- To avoid shooting in the same spot more than once I've had to declare GetNearHit function which gives list of coords that have already been shot.
- GetNearShip takes coordinates and returns free spaces to shoot

GameBoard -> This class creates propertie SpaceOnBoards which is later commonly used to get a specified coordinates, also contains GameBoard() object who generates boards to fire and place ships

SpaceOnBoard -> contains definition of exact point on board, type of Point( is that a ship or free place to shoot, or even if that point has previously been shoot)
Contains:
- Status which gives back string which contains type of 'Mark' which is point status(free, ship, missed)
- IsTaken returns boolean which is obviously needed to create gaming board and fullfill it with ships.
